## Musing 5 

Building on the thoughts from yesterday, there are a lot of practical ways in which work is an idol. 

There are various ways in which modern Americans display this. One is how we often root our identity in our
profession. Another is in how we so easily break the Sabbath for work.

To start these thoughts, consider Westminster Larger Catechism questions 120 and 121 :

Q. 120. What are the reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it?
A. The reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it, are taken from the equity of it, 
God allowing us six days of seven for our own affairs, and reserving but one for himself, in these words, 
six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work: from God’s challenging a special propriety in that day, the 
seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: from the example of God, who in six days made heaven and 
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: and from that blessing which God put 
upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day for his service, but in ordaining it to be a means 
of blessing to us in our sanctifying it, wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath-day and hallowed it.

Q. 121. Why is the word remember set in the beginning of the fourth commandment?
A. The word remember is set in the beginning of the fourth commandment, partly, because of the great benefit
of remembering it, we being thereby helped in our preparation to keep it; and, in keeping it, better to keep 
all the rest of the commandments, and to continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of creation 
and redemption, which contain a short abridgement of religion; and partly, because we are very ready to forget it,
for that there is less light of nature for it, and yet it restraineth our natural liberty in things at other times 
lawful; that it cometh but once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come between, and too often take off 
our minds from thinking of it, either to prepare for it, or to sanctify it; and that Satan with his instruments 
much labor to blot out the glory, and even the memory of it, to bring in all irreligion and impiety.


Even setting aside how Sabbatarian one ought to be in their following of Jesus, there are immense practical
considerations here.  Our ignoring the Sabbath leads us to devalue the gathering of the saints on Sundays, something
we are commanded not to neglect. 

But more than that, when we idolize sports, work, money, recreation, and things that take our eyes off of God, we 
in turn don't feel the rest that can only be found in Jesus.  

And what happens when we turn to those idols on what should be our day of rest? We find none. The god of money can not 
bring comfort or security. Sure, if we possess it, we can shortly stave off the endless demands of the world. But what 
happens? Our savings deplete, inflation rises, and temporary joys demand more and more money. And before you know it, 
the money is spent, and another round of expenses has come.

But when we rest, and we seek to honor God by pursuing Him on His day, we find the true rest and true supply. Our Father
has promised to care for us and make provision. In this day and age, when  employers are so happy to employ one day and 
layoff the next, we cannot look to them for true provision. Businesses fail, but our Father who owns all creation, can
and does make provision for His people. 

So put work in its place, and rest. Let work have its 6 days, give it all so that you honor God, but rest and take delight
in your creator, for that is your greatest purpose.
