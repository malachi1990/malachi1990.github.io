## Musing 20

As I've looked back even on just the last few weeks of writing, I already feel my thinking starting to be clearer, though 
only a little.

While I hope my writing has improved over these first 20 musings, I also know a lot has gone on in my life that impacts these.

Oftentimes, these are the last things I do each day, and so it's often just the dregs of my energy after work and caring 
for a little one that gets put into this work.

But it is rewarding. Between having a tangible measure of my discipline and being noticeably more effective at gathering 
and expressing my thoughts (especially when I'm well rested!), I think I made the right decision to shout into the void.

My ultimate hope is that over the course of the year, increasing my discipline in multiple areas of life will have dividends.
What those dividends will be, I don't know. 

I know I've wanted to write a book (both fiction and non-fiction) and hopefully this will be a stepping stone to that. But we'll see.
