## Musing 21

Abraham Kuyper that there is not a single square inch of creation of which Christ does not say "MINE!". 

Once we recognize that, we begin to understand how the rest of life ought to be ordered. Because Christ is our Creator
and our King, He alone has the right to define what is and is not appropriate. 

However, while that rule has begun, we as Christians still live in a foreign land. And so how do we acknowledge Christ's
reign over us while still in a world that is at war with Him?

I think first, we ourselves bow the knee to Christ in all aspects of our lives. We recognize that God is our true provider for
everything and we seek His kingdom first. 

Second, we recognize the world is still in rebellion to its creator, and so as we interact with the world, we do not expect the world 
to prioritize Christ or look for the world to behave in a Christian manner. For those of us in the West, this can at times
be hard *because* we have a distinctly Christian milieu that even the majority of non-Christians to some extent have a Christianity inspired
morality (though in the last 50 years, we have seen the world seek to accelerate to throw off that heritage).

There is much to explore within these points on their own, let alone how they interact. 

Much ink has been spilt over things like just war theory, evangelism, Christian politics and activism and the like. Fundamentally though, 
it all comes back to these 2 points though. 

As we Christians seek to make Christ known in this world, may we take heart that the victory is won and that the resistance
is but a fading ember. While such resistance to Christ's will may seem so strong, as the old hymn says, God has said one little word shall fell 
the enemy. 

May we rest in Christ's sovereignty over all things and go boldly.
