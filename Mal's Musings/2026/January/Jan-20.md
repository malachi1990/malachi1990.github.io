## Musing 13

One of the great sins of our era is that because we love lies, we in turn let this lead us to despise education.

"How can you say that? We live in the most educated age, after all!" 

And on the one hand, you're right. We have the most opportunity to better our prospects and understand creation at a 
truly deep level. 

On the other though, what do we commonly hear of? Teachers struggling with class sizes and low pay. Sports coaches for
*schools* having multi-million dollar contracts while the professors barely make ends meet or being dependent on research
grants to keep their jobs. 

We are told that you will know false teachers by their fruit. And the fruit of our society's "love" for education smells 
rotten.

And what is the antidote? 

In a cliche way, it's the gospel. We need to be freed from the fear of learning things that seem to contradict our 
worldview because it threatens our sense of control. 

In practice, we need to value understanding God's creation, that our children be well educated, and that we must give an accounting
for whether we love truth or lies.
