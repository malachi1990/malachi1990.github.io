## Musing 9

As I re-read Ryle's Practical Religion, I am reminded about the saying "the ink still smudges", meaning that though 
the work is old, it reads like it could have been written today.

Truly, as much as we think ourselves so far beyond our forebears, one need only look at the world around us and see 
how quickly people make the same mistakes our ancestors did, or how the same relational problems occur, even though
new technology may give different opportunities for sin to manifest.

And it seems the world too is starting to come to terms with that reality. I've increasingly read stories where a major
theme was "the old ways are the good ways, abandon the new", or some variation on this. And the allure is understandable.

We feel the pressure of daily life, the unending hunger of "more" caused by our idolatry of money and stuff, and we want
rest. And that simple life of yesteryear feels freeing. It gives us the promise that there *is* freedom from the grind 
of hustle culture that increasingly feels like nothing but death warmed over.

As Christians this presents an opportunity for us. Despite those saying Christianity needs to change or die, we live in an
age primed to hear "the old paths that are well-worn are indeed good!" The way to the cross, narrow though it may be, fraught
with peril on the left and right, alone can bring salve for our consciences that are so bothered by the sin and brokenness
in the world. 

We have a rich history of Christians who have gone before us who faithfully gone on before and who have given us much wisdom
to learn from. In this day when the new wine of 24/7 onlineness and having every relationship be transactionally maintained, 
let us drink of the old wine of God's saving, and freeing grace. Let that blessed drink unburden us and bring us true rest
in our union with our Savior.
