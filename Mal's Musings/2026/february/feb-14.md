## Musing 31

On a few occasions, I've mentioned how we need to break out from worldly patterns when we come to conclusions. But what does that look like?

By example, I'm going to give an example of the framework that I use when analyzing issues of the day. These questions are
not necessarily asked in any specific order and sometimes how I encounter an issue determines that order. A more theoretical 
conversation with a friend may go in the exact order I lay out, while reading a news piece may have me start by asking about the
sin in the situation.


- Are there direct, clear scriptural statements on the topic?

As a Christian, where Scripture leads, we must follow, even if unpopular.  There are clear moral commands and precepts that, 
because human nature has not changed, still apply.

- If there aren't, are there principles of general equity or teachings in Scripture that may have application?

Because of our distance from the time of enscripturation, there are many specific things that Scripture does not address 
by simple virtue of said issues not being a concept in people's minds. As a few examples - Christian views of AI, or how 
we should navigate privatized healthcare, etc.

However, there are principles that will still apply. A simple case in point is that of wage theft. While Scripture may not
directly tell an employer what to pay their employees, there are clear teachings about caring for the poor and not stealing 
wages that would most certainly be relevant.

Other examples may include things like "to whom much is given, much will be required" or "do your work as unto the Lord". Much of Scripture 
is concerned about the day-to-day life, and we would be remiss to not even look for indirect applications.


- Where is the sin in the situation?

We live in a fallen world. It is well said that even if Satan and the world did not entice us to sin, our own flesh would still 
seek to entice us away from righteousness.

And so when we deal with people, sin is an inevitability. Whether it is our sin, another person's sin, or simply the consequences
of living in a fallen world. 

- How is the gospel brought to action?

While at first glance, this seems similar to questions 1 and 2, it is distinctly different in that questions 1-3 are really 
about understanding the issue so that we can wisely act in a way that points to Jesus.

Scripture is clear that faith without works is dead in multiple places. But in order to know how to love our neighbor well, 
we need to discern their needs. 

And so we must move from simple understanding into taking action.

And those are the core questions. Nothing really groundbreaking, but lately I've more and more seen well-read Christians approach 
topics like worldlings. And to be clear, at times I may ask myself other questions, like "How can sin take advantage of any action takes?" 
or "What are deeper implications of points of doctrine on this topic beyond the most direct applications?" as the need arises. This set
of questions is just the bare minimum to get the process started.
