## Musing 28

A couple musings ago, I mentioned the book [We Become What We Worship](https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/we-become-what-we-worship-g-k-beale-9780830828777) 
as one of my favorite books. 

One of the key reasons is that despite it being the cure for insomnia, it becomes eminently apparent how practical theology is 
while not spending most of its time doing so. 

As Americans, we often have a view of idolatry that is too theoretical. We think of idolatry as something that really only happens in places like India, 
Africa, or some other place overseas. But the reality is that blatant idolatry is right here in America in all sorts of forms.

As a brief aside, in the Reformed camp, there are 2 ways to commit idolatry - either by violating the first commandment or the second commandment. Most of the time, 
Reformed people speak of idolatry as it pertains to worshipping God in the way that He has proscribed.  This musing is about idolatry as it pertains to the first 
commandment.

The simple reality is that by almost any objective metric, the vast majority of professing Christians in America have an idol named Jesus. 
Jesus Himself testifies that there will be many on the last day who say to Him "Lord, Lord" but to whom He says "Depart from Me, I never knew
you, you workers of lawlessness". 

There is a sad, terrifying reality to that. To think you have been worshipping the true God all along, but in reality have simply deluded yourself
and are following a god you yourself made up and don't find out until it's too late.  And remember, the people of whom Jesus said these words
were not mere pew-sitters. These would be the ones "on fire for Jesus", the ones we immediately think of as "good" Christians because of their outward works.
But if you read Matthew 7, note the basis on which people justify themselves. They do not point to God's mercy and grace, but their works. And so, by their
works, Jesus condemns them. Sin 

And so, don't tarry, take stock of yourself. Do you love sin and hate righteousness and holiness? Do you have a sin you refuse to hate and leave behind
for Christ? Are there parts of your life that you don't put through the filter of "What has God said about this"?

If you can't answer those questions with certainty, take it to God in repentance. Do not wait. Do not let yourself stay in deception.
