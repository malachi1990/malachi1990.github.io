## Musing 27

One of the most interesting RPG supplements I've ever enjoyed is 13th Age's Book of Ages (purchase [here!](https://pelgranepress.com/product/book-of-ages/)).

Having a guided way to generate a fantasy world with your friends is great. And so one of the projects I've wanted to work on
for myself is writing a desktop app to a) make it easy to run through the exercise for when I want to build a world for any 
book I write in the future. 

So today's musing is me taking time to work on this.
